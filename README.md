# JSGameEngine

HEADS UP: THIS IS -INCREDIBLY- ROUGH AND UNFINISHED AT THE MOMENT

A scrappy little side project between myself (Paul Cho) and my friend Chris King to create a fully functioning game engine entirely out of vanilla JS - no frameworks, no APIs, just a lot of self-written code and a lot of coffee.

The current goals of the project are:
..* To help reinforce engine design ideas within ourselves, to ensure we actually understand how engines work
..* To bolster our ability to accomplish neat things in JS without having to use somebody else's pre-crafted solution
..* To create an engine in a language that allows both for web launching and desktop/mobile launching

In it's current state, the engine core is still very much unfinished, so it will be awhile before anything is actually built out of it. Nonetheless, Chris and I are taking this as an opportunity to work together (something we've talked about for a long time) and make something that will ultimately help us walk away with some useful knowledge, and, if we're lucky, an engine we can actually use to develop stuff!
